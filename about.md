#Hello there! I'm Yen Peng, and I made a website for no reason!#
<br>
I came across a story on Autostraddle [article link here](https://www.autostraddle.com/this-lesbian-made-her-own-dating-website-and-it-will-blow-you-away-378346/) about a woman who created her very own dating profile website, complete with testimonials from close friends and family on how amazing (and dateable) she is!
<br>
I found the idea really endearing, and immediately thought back to an old Github page I created about 2 years ago which was left to languish in inactivity ever since I moved to Melbourne. So I thought why not give it a shot at bringing it back to life!
<br>
#My story so far#
<br>
 I'm a 25-year old Malaysian currently based in Melbourne for the last 2 years. 

#What do I do?#
By day, I am a modeller, developing highly dynamic bespoke models tailored to different clients & purposes. 
<br>
By night, if not working, I am at the gym, reading, or meddling with this website from time to time.
<br>
<br>
My interests include fitness, travelling, karaoke, the great outdoors, arts and crafts, reading, financial modelling and surfing the internet in search of new / fun things to pick up.

This website is part of a response to the abovementioned quote, which spurred my intention to start picking up some coding skills. In this digital age where our lives are increasingly immersed in technology, it does not take long before coding becomes as basic as reading and writing. I suppose this website will never be ready, ever remaining in "beta" stage as I pursue this budding interest in tiny steps.

It is somewhat akin to the nature of being human. After all, we are all work in progress. What matters is what you choose to work on.
