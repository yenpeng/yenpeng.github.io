**I am Yen Peng**
<br>
<br>
By day, I work in a large global accounting firm in Malaysia as a financial advisory professional involved in business valuations, infrastructure financial feasibility studies and various advisory work. 

By night, if not working, I am at the gym, reading, or meddling with this website from time to time.

My interests include fitness, travelling, outdoors, financial modelling, arts and crafts, reading and surfing the internet in search of new / fun things to pick up. 

This website is part of a response to the abovementioned quote, which spurred my intention to start picking up some basic coding skills. I suppose this website will never be ready, remaining in "beta" stage, akin to the nature of being human. 
<br>
We are all work in progress. What matters is what you choose to work on.
