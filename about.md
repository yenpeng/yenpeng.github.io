  If we wait until we're ready, we'll be waiting for the rest of our lives.

##Hi! I'm Yen Peng. I made a website for no reason, but you're welcome to look around!##
I came across a story on Autostraddle.com (https://www.autostraddle.com/this-lesbian-made-her-own-dating-website-and-it-will-blow-you-away-378346/)

 By day, I work in a large global accounting firm in Malaysia as a financial advisory professional involved in business valuations, infrastructure financial feasibility studies and various advisory work. 
<br>
<br>
By night, if not working, I am at the gym, reading, or meddling with this website from time to time.
<br>
<br>
My interests include fitness, travelling, karaoke, the great outdoors, arts and crafts, reading, financial modelling and surfing the internet in search of new / fun things to pick up. 
<br>

This website is part of a response to the abovementioned quote, which spurred my intention to start picking up some coding skills. In this digital age where our lives are increasingly immersed in technology, it does not take long before coding becomes as basic as reading and writing. I suppose this website will never be ready, ever remaining in "beta" stage as I pursue this budding interest in tiny steps. 
<br>
<br>
It is somewhat akin to the nature of being human. After all, we are all work in progress. What matters is what you choose to work on.
