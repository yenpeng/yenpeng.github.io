# Hello there! I'm Yen Peng. 


### I made a website for no reason!


I'm a 25-year old Malaysian based in Melbourne for the last 2 years.

Loving life, working hard, enjoying my immense freedom as a single professional living in a small cosmopolitan city. Every once in a while, I do new things that tickle my fancy, just like this website here!


----------


## What is this about?

I came across a story on Autostraddle [article link here](https://www.autostraddle.com/this-lesbian-made-her-own-dating-website-and-it-will-blow-you-away-378346/) about a woman who created her very own dating profile website, complete with testimonials from close friends and family on how amazing (and dateable) she is!


I found the idea cute and endearing, and immediately thought back to an old Github page I created years ago which was left to languish in inactivity after a bout of syntax frustrations and lack of grit. This time I thought, why not give it a shot at bringing it back to life!

Sometimes,
* I do some sporty / outdoor activities e.g. indoor rock-climbing, hiking

And also,
* I used to do a lot of jigsaw puzzles, cuz I'm patient like that

## What do I do?

By day, I am a modeller, developing highly dynamic bespoke models tailored to different clients & purposes. And no, my type of modelling does not belong in the pages of a magazine, but rather nestled and nurtured in the exciting sheets of Excel. I also review highly complex models built by other people, usually banks, and tell them where things can be improved.


Numbers and models are two of my life's passions. I've been doing this for 5 years, and I love what I do! Hours are insane sometimes, and people think I'm crazy to be pulling endless late nights during the peak months, but I suppose everyone has their own brand of fun!

## So what now?


Whilst this website is not intended to be a dating profile, I'll be honest and admit that hopefully parts of it left an impression on you, some of my more "dateable qualities". If you have found me interesting enough as a human to have coffee / tea with, drop a hellow my way! 

Is this precocious? Somewhat. But it's more effort on me than my swiping right on you could ever amount to elsewhere in the digital world, and hopefully this makes the difference :)
