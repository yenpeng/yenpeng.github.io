# Hello there! I'm Yen Peng. 


### Thanks for dropping by my personal website.


I'm a full-time financial & business modeller in a multinational advisory firm, solving and reviewing complex financing / business concepts for clients everyday. I am also an on-off budding code enthusiast, trying my hand at creating my own website through the help of the internet. And right now you're checking out my little experiment!

Born and bred a Malaysian, I've been based in Melbourne for the last 2 years. Amidst the crazy deadlines that accompany my job, I'm enjoying my immense freedom as a single professional living in a small cosmopolitan city.

## What is this about?

Moving abroad to a brand new country where nobody knows you is scary. It's even scarier when you've led a sheltered life (i.e. living with your parents) all the while and shuddered at the thought of paying your own bills. Even after a few months when you think you have adapted to this foreign soil, you will still come across oddities that catch you offguard, or wrestle with sudden bouts of loneliness as you form new friendships in this new home of yours.

The experience abroad has been a tremendous eye-opener, and I've been incredibly lucky to have such a great opportunity handed to me this early in life. As I navigate through life in a brand new country, I've assumed new layers of identities creating intersectionalities within my being, I've faced questions on my existing identities through the eyes of new people who may not necessarily understand me. 

I'm keen to explore how displacement simultaneously created a zeal for life and a void in me. Living abroad has pulled the adventurous spirit out of me and into the world, it was as if I had swallowed my own key of independence all this time. Notwithstanding the newfound yolo mojo, as I search and search to belong in this new country, I find that the same slow yearning still hums underneath, a reminder that sometimes the things you look for are not found by simply moving around. I hope to explore some of these "oddities" as I wrangle my way through syntax frustrations - this is after all, a website project first and foremost, second as a blog.

## A bit about myself

I really like:
* Hitting the Crossfit gym 
* The cinemas
* Karaoke (off-key, mostly)
* Making my apartment look pretty
* Reading
* Travelling 
* Concerts
* Coffee (average 3 cups a day)

Sometimes,
* I do some sporty / outdoor activities e.g. indoor rock-climbing, hiking
* Dabble in arts / crafts 

And also,
* I used to do a lot of jigsaw puzzles, yes I'm patient like that

## What inspired this website?


I came across a story on Autostraddle ([article link here](https://www.autostraddle.com/this-lesbian-made-her-own-dating-website-and-it-will-blow-you-away-378346/)) about a woman who created her very own dating profile website, complete with testimonials from close friends and family on how amazing she is. This was simply too cute, and made me think of what other purpose a personal website could fulfill apart from the default professional resume webpage most creatives have.


As I try new things in life, I'll post them up here too!
