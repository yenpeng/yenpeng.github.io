# Every week I try to do something new

Okay, maybe every other week, given how much I love to sleep in on weekends. Let's start with some goals (yay).

By the end of 2018: 
* Travel Australia as much as I can - I'm looking at you Tassie, Fraser & Whitsundays, Darwin
* Cycle *well* enough
* ~~Have a six-pack~~ (my macros diet have gone awry the past few weeks!) 
* Do more Crossfit, lift more pump more
* Do not let work interfere with my life in the way it has the past few months 
* Get better at this Jekyll thing

## Stretch Goals

Moving to Melbourne was one of the best things I did in my life. I would love to try this again, this whole "starting life all over", in somewhere new.

I've been labelled as intense, "very out there" and highly resilient. I've been told that I live life on the fast lane, which is funny since I don't even have a car.

Whatever the words are, I do love trying something new from time to time. I'll use this experimental blog to keep track of my experimental gigs, be it fleeting, adrenaline-filled or just downright awkward. I'm sure it's mostly awkward.
