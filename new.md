# Every week I try to do something new

Okay, maybe every other week, given how much I love to sleep in on weekends.

Let's start with some goals (yay).

# Looking Ahead

By the end of 2018: 
* Travel Australia as much as I can - I'm looking at you Tassie, Fraser & Whitsundays, Darwin
* Cycle *well* enough
* ~~Have a six-pack~~ (my macros diet have gone awry the past few weeks!) 
* Do more Crossfit, lift more pump more
* Do not let work interfere with my life in the way it has the past few months 
* Get better at this Jekyll thing

## Stretch Goals

Moving to Melbourne was one of the best things I did in my life. I would love to try it again, this starting life all over again, in somewhere new.

I've been labelled as intense, "very out there" and highly resilient. I've been told that I live life on the fast lane, which is funny since I don't even have a car.

Whatever the words are, I do love trying something new from time to time. I'll use this experimental blog to keep track of my experimental gigs, be it fleeting, adrenaline-filled or just downright awkward. I'm sure it's mostly awkward.

And hopefully during the lazier winter weeks when I'm 15 hours into a TV binge marathon, I'll look back at these posts and realise just how much fun the world out there brings, I'll get my bum off the couch (and hopefully yours too) and get going again.
