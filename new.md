# Every week I try to do something new

  Better an oops than a what if.

It could be something small, or it could be really rad like throwing myself off a ledge. Or a plane. You go big or you go home.

Some people have said I can be intense. Some have said I'm "very out there", resilient, or just plain passionate. I've even been told that I live life on the fast lane, which is funny considering I don't have a car! 

Whatever the words people use to describe me, I do love trying something new from time to time. I'll use this experimental blog to keep track of my experimental gigs, be it fleeting, adrenaline-filled or just downright awkward. 

And hopefully during the lazier winter weeks when I'm 15 hours into a TV binge marathon, I'll look back at these posts and realise just how much fun the world out there brings, I'll get my bum off the couch and get going!
