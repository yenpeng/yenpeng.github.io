#Yen Peng's Experimental Website

##About
Created in the spur of a moment to learn what goes on behind a webpage, this has been a real challenging learning curve given my zero IT and coding background. 

After much fussing about and late night tweakings, here's [Yen Peng - Home of Aspirations](http://yenpeng.github.io/).


##Demo

This is how my baby looks like. Still in early WIP stages.
