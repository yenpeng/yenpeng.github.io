# Looking Ahead

Currently I've set myself a few goals to achieve by the end of 2018: 
* Travel Australia as much as I can - I'm looking at you Tassie, Fraser & Whitsundays, Darwin
* Cycle *well* enough
* ~~Have a six-pack~~ (my macros diet have gone awry the past few weeks!) 
* Go to Crossfit more! Lift more pump more!
* Meet more new people
* Get better at this Jekyll thing and have a nicer website

## Stretch Goals

Moving to Melbourne was one of the best things that happened in my life.
