My greatest pitfall in losing and maintaining weight is my habit of seeking solace in food.
Whilst the previous post was largely based on my self-observation and anecdotal opinions, here I will share with you my previous experience in losing weight effectively but maintaining weight horribly.

Previous Weight Loss Experience 
In college, I decided that moping about my weight was not going to get me anywhere and immediately lunged into an intensive low-carb diet.
I was very successful, having lost 11 kgs over 8 months. The modus operandi was sticking to a gruelling diet that cuts out most carbs save for wholemeal bread, corn flakes, vegetables and fruits. A lot of fatty and sugary foods were avoided as well, but I was also eating a lot of processed foods (frozen processed seafood items) as my “light protein”. I also consumed a lot of red meat during this period, and portion sizes were reduced considerable. Snacks included yogurt and apples.

I hardly exercised as I am by nature a person who loathes sports for the discomfort they cause with all the sweat, exhaustion and heavy heartbeat. The dieting period was broken into two parts, in which during the first three to four months I lost 5 kgs. My body then hit a plateau, where I was finding it difficult to lose weight further due to my body’s defense mechanism. I gave myself two weeks to resume a regular diet with increased carb intake, hoping that the additional food consumption would fuel the metabolism to enter a higher gear.
Subsequently, I lost another 5 to 6 kgs during the second part of the low carb diet, exercising together control on food portion, mealtimes and nutrition composition.

The diet worked like a charm, and I was flaunting a really slim figure by the end of the year. My weight loss was very visible and I received endless comments about it, which made my self-esteem shoot up sky high. I felt amazing.

Of course, there was the downside too. I was left tired easily due to the lack of carbs. I felt more faint compared to my fatter days. Sometimes my mind could not concentrate.
I also went through a hair loss stage due to the shock caused by the drastic change in diet, which pushed my healthy living hairs to enter the telogen phase much sooner than normal and made them fall out even more. 

What followed next was even more astounding to even myself. I kept that weight reasonably consistent for more than 3 years from college second year to my first year at work (2011 - 2013)
Sure I was skinny fat, but as long as I could fit into size S it was good enough for me.
 
How did I do it?
Unhealthy relationship with food. One that is largely fuelled by guilt. 
Think calorie-counting till the cows come home. 
Although I did not have any eating disorders, I was thinking about weight loss and food and calories incessantly to the point I did not care much about anything else. It was an obsession, which translated into constant paranoia over how a piece of chocolate or cake would make me fat again. 
Over time the mind and the body learned, viewing unhealthy foods as EVIL. Over time, the guilt stuck. It became harder to manage as I could barely eat anything outside without feeling guilty for the excess oil, sugar, salt, fat, calories. Every meal was in excess of unhealthy things. 

It was a very unhealthy state of mind to be in.

And of course, I annoyed the crap out of my family with my endless talk on nutrition and yes, getting fat.

Present situation - Relapse. 
Complete and total relapse. I have almost gone back to my pre-college fat days.
I have unsightly folds in my tummy, my bat wings are worse off than before, even my face has gotten larger.
The only perk I get out of the weight gain are bigger boobs. Well, slightly…but still appreciated nonetheless. 
I can no longer fit in most of my body-hugging tees and have to get clothes higher up one to two sizes. I stopped watching the scales, preferring to be cloaked in denial as I slowly gained in weight and in fat mass. I ate whatever and whenever I want. 

It is disheartening, how I let myself go like that. I distinctly remembered vowing to myself not to let myself return to my fatter days.

It only serves to show how complacent I have grown and how prideful I was in thinking that I would never get fat again.

Why relapse? 
1. Sick of suppressing my love for unhealthy food (yeah, blame it on the food!)
2. Inconsistent and ineffective workout regime at home. Utterly misguided with poor knowledge and direction on fitness 
3. Motivation levels to maintain weight plummeted as complacency kicked in
4. Long, gruelling hours at work meant no time for working out
5. I have always hated working out anyway

Introspection
This has happened after my first attempt in losing weight. Given my food-as-reward mechanism, it will very much happen again if left unmonitored and uncontrolled for the second time.
Due to my sedentary lifestyle spending the whole day sitting and poor eating habits, my metabolism hit a low which makes fat loss even more difficult for this second attempt I am taking.
Patience test? Definitely, but I have waited 8 months for the weight to come off the first round, and I will undoubtedly wait even longer for this time.
