# The fun begins when...

People ask for my name, because it's a mini MCQ test where I instantly decide on the following name variants best suit the occasion:

* Yen Peng
* Yen
* YP / YPL
* All of the above
* Neither of the above - I'm Britney bitch


Yen Peng is the right answer, but somehow it's too hard for some people. So Yen it is, especially for takeaway coffees and bars. Then as I get to know a person better there comes the awkward conversation to start *getting* them to call me Yen Peng, it goes a little like this...

**Me:** Hey uh, by the way I usually go by Yen Peng.
**Them:** Oh I thought you're Yen!
**Me:** Yeah that's one half of my first name ....
** Them:** *(forgets Peng anyway...)*

Sometimes I try to make life easier by coming up with a hook:

**Me:** Hi I'm Yen Peng! Yen for Japanese currency, Peng for pingpong (no, not a typo)...
**Them:** *(bemused)* I like it! 
**Them:** *(forgets it anyway...)*

And so it goes....
