# I dread it when...

People ask for my name, because within a split second I have to decide on what variant of my name I should let them call me by:

* Yen Peng
* Yen
* YP
* YPL
* Peng
* Yen Peng Lee
* Lee Yen Peng
* a host of other nicknames which are too embarassing

It's an MCQ test I face on a daily basis, with no right or wrong answer given the outcome is solely based on my judgment on how likely I'll see that person again. 

My preferred name is Yen Peng. But apparently this is too hard for a lot of people.

If it's just a name for takeaway coffee, Yen is sweet and simple. Even at bars and parties, I go by Yen just because it's just too loud for any ear to fully catch anything else.
