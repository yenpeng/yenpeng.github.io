# It's a funny feeling...

Having lived in Melbourne for some time, I have grown to love the place a lot that it has become a "personal" home to me, away from my "family" home in Malaysia where my family and friends reside. It has given me refuge from the existing structures that used to govern my life growing up in my home country. Here I am given the freedom to conveniently leave behind, or forget, the obligations that grounded me back home when I stepped into adulthood. Here I take on whatever identity I choose to, live the sort of life I want to lead, having to answer to only myself.

Sure, I come home to an empty apartment, which I've taken pains to transform into a place that I can feel truly at home. It's not quite the same, materials cannot compensate for human warmth, music blasting from the speakers does not sound the same as laughter.
